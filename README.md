# MultiCopier

**MultiCopier** is a simple backup tool for syncing files and folders from one place to another. 

## How it works

The app checks for differences between your source and target folders, then:

- Copies new or updated files to the target
- Deletes files and folders in the target that are missing from the source
- Keeps your **source** untouched and safe

## Setup

To get started:

1. Select the root folder you want to back up.
2. Specify at least one backup destination folder where your files will be synced.
3. Run the tool.

## System Requirements

- Windows 10 or newer (64-bit recommended)
- .NET 8 runtime installed
